                      and my story began in May'21. Master's was ending and
                      minds were blocked. However, research ideas were still
                      stimulating. I got desperate to begin something new.
                      Flurried here and there but all in vain. Then Mihir
                      suggested me to try at IIM Raipur. I was told that the
                      professors at IIms are most easily approachable. Then why
                      not give it a try? And indeed it was true. I contacted a
                      professor and I got a response within a few hours. It was
                      a conversation over mail and
                      <a class="theme-color">I got Hired!</a> for conducting
                      research under his mentorship. The prof wasn't much aware
                      of my capabilities and he was taking a chance. (I have a
                      slight idea that he was impressed by my profile.) He asked
                      me to choose one of his three project ideas. I got to work
                      on
                      <a class="theme-color">Bitcoin Price Prediction.</a>
                      The project was to implement an LSTM autoencoder
                      regularized by False Nearest Neighbor loss. I knew LSTM
                      very well back then. I knew autoencoders. But I had never
                      heard about FNN. There was a paper on FNN by a Harvard
                      professor which I never wanted to read (thinking Harvard
                      papers won't ever get into my mind). So, I could implement
                      the LSTM Autoencoder but not the FNN. Another trouble was,
                      the reference codes were in R. I had never encountered an
                      R code before. And now I had to learn R. It is said that R
                      is easy but I never consider so at first about any
                      programming language. (P.S.:
                      <a class="theme-color">I hated Programming.</a>)
                      Anyhow, I started implementing. I was getting closer
                      somehow by repeatedly reading a single blog and the codes
                      but not at all the Harvard guy's paper. Then came a day, R
                      implementation was successful. Not to forget, the results.
                      Those were dreadful! Then I was trying multiple ways to
                      get around it. Some things worked out, some didn't. I
                      wasn't satisfied. Then I thought to re-implement the code
                      in Python. I thought it would be easier to optimize in a
                      familiar language. Yes, it was. Everything worked out
                      fine, except for the FNN code, again! I asked few of my
                      friends for help but no good results. One of them asked me
                      to go back and read the Harvard paper and then get back to
                      him. You guessed it right, I didn't read it. My ideology
                      is to first implement the things and then understand the
                      underlying concepts. I might be wrong at this point, I
                      admit. Somehow the code was fixed and honestly, there
                      wasn't much to be done to fix it, which was realized
                      later. My experiments smoothly began and I had good
                      results. All of this happened within 10 days of time. I
                      conveyed the results to my prof and began with the draft.
                      I had to compile a 2000-word manuscript, second shortest
                      of my life. And I felt I wasn't able to do it. I couldn't
                      begin. I couldn't write a single word. And this was
                      happenning after I had successfully written seven papers.
                      All I was doing is procrastination. Its common among
                      researchers. I had set a deadline in my mind to submit the
                      manuscript by May 31. On 30th evening, I began to write.
                      On June 1, I submitted the 1997-word draft. The professor
                      reviewed it and asked me to make minor changes. (Probably
                      he wants a 3000-word draft now.) And guess what? Its June
                      16th and I'm still procrastinating.
